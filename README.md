# Deprecated Repository, only for posterity

Since the schemas proved to be useful, they are now part of the official specification repository and can be found at:
https://github.com/VDA5050/VDA5050


# vd-m-a-5050
JSON Schemas for the use with the VD(M)A 5050 protocol.

These schemas track the internal revisions made to the protocol, from its inception up until its release.

The VDA publication of the VDA 5050 2.0 is the same version as the internal 5.0.0.

The different released versions (including internal revisions) are in different branches.

Older versions are only for documentation and should not be used.
